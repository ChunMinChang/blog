<p>I have two firefox: Firefox(normal version) and Firefox Developer Edition.
Today morning, I deleted the Firefox Developer Edition by <em>AppCleaner</em>
and re-installed it, then something weird happened.</p>

<p>When I opened the new Firefox Developer Edition
then launched my unchanged Firefox, the Firefox cannot be opened
and it showed an error: <strong>A copy of Firefox is already open.
Only one copy of Firefox an be opened at a time.</strong></p>

<p>AFAIK, the multiple Firefox instances are able to run at the same time,
if they use <strong>different profiles</strong>.
Therefore, I opened <code class="highlighter-rouge">about:profiles</code> on Firefox to check it.</p>

<p>From above, the setting was incorrect.
It should use <em>Profile: default</em> instead of <em>Profile: dev-edition-default</em>.
That’s why I cannot open Firefox and FirefoxDeveloperEdition at the same time.</p>

<p>To fix the problem, I simply click <em>Set a default profile</em>
under <em>Profile: default</em>, then closed it, and relaunched it to check the setting.</p>

<p>I also checked the FirefoxDeveloperEdition’s setting
to make sure everything is fine.

<p>I wrote this to remember how I fix it,
in case the same problem happens again.</p>
