I"ô<p>My very first memory of my grandpa is that he stepped awkwardly in the hall of my preschool. He picked me up everyday. I lived with my grandparents before going to university.</p>

<p>I am the favorite grandchild of my grandpa, although I am not the firstborn grandson. I am the second one. The firstborn son is considered the most important son in the family. However, I am the only one grandson that can speak Taiwanese, which is my grandpaâ€™s native language and also mine. Speaking Taiwanese in public was illegal in Taiwan many years ago due to political issues and thatâ€™s one of the reason why many young people in Taiwan cannot speak Taiwanese.</p>

<p>My grandpa always wants me to get a Phd degree in the U.S. because that is his American dream. His highest education is elementary school. If you only graduated from elementary school, the life would not be easy. Having a Phd degree in the United States means having a good life in a free world for him. (However, I never try it. I was busy making money to pay bills.)</p>

<p>About one year ago, somehow I got a job offer to work in the the United States. I took that chance and moved here to start a new life. My grandpa was so happy about that. He thought I might be able to achieve his American dream.</p>

<p>Three months later after moving here, in middle October, I got a phone call from my mom. She said: â€œYour grandpa may be dying. He cannot remember things. He is lying in bed all day and most of the time he is in sleep. We donâ€™t know how long this will last. He is too old.â€</p>

<p>After hanging up the phone, I started searching the flight ticket back to Taiwan. Itâ€™s bloody expensive and I donâ€™t have many time-offs. I just started my new job here and I was assigned to a challenging project. I donâ€™t want to mess it up. Itâ€™s my first project of my first job in the United States. So I booked the ticket in Thanksgiving days.</p>

<p>I called home every week to check my grandpa. However, there was only one time he was awake. I had a video chat with him. During our chat, he looked the camera, and said: â€œThe girl next to you is pretty. You should marry her.â€. I said â€œShe is my wife, alreadyâ€. Then he laughed and said he couldnâ€™t
remember things these days. Then he said he was tired, so we ended our chat. A few minutes later, my mom called me again and said: â€œYour grandpa asks me to push you for a Phdâ€, and I just laughed.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, my grandpa passed away. I really regretted I was not being there with him. I rearranged an earlier ticket back to Taiwan.</p>

<p>After funeral, I told to my mom that I was truly sorry I was not being there with him. But my mom said: â€œThatâ€™s fine. You are not the firstborn son. Itâ€™s ok.â€. Her response really surprised me. I really donâ€™t know what it mean actually. However, it makes me think: â€œDid my grandpa care about that? What does my grandpa care?â€. I donâ€™t know. I still donâ€™t have an answer today. But one thing for sure is that I will have a better life than his.</p>
