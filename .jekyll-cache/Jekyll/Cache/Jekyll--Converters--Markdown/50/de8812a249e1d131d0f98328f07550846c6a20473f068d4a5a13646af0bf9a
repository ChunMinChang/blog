I"Þ<p>To make some fun in a snowing night,
I built a simple audio reactive LED
that can dance(blink) with the music.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an easy project for killing time
since the circuit just contains a couple of electronic components.</p>

<p>I am not a professional electronic engineer.
I cannot guarantee it wonâ€™t burn down your house
if you run that circuit all night long.</p>

<p>I bet you will get much more fun
if you dance with real humans rather than the LED circuit!</p>
