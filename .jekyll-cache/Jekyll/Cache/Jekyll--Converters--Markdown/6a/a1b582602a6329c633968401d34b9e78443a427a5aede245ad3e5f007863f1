I"Å<p>To develop a cross-platform audio library,
I need to switch between computers
with different OS frequently
to check if my code works on different platforms.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s annoying to unconnect the speaker from one computer
and then connect it to another one again and again.
Therefore, I made a device selector that can switch the audio source
of the speaker by simply flipping a switch.</p>

<h2 id="circuit">Circuit</h2>
<p>The circuit is super easy. Itâ€™s nothing more than a switch.

<p>The above circuit diagram is for stereo(<em>2</em>-channels) speaker.
If the speaker layout is 5.1(<em>6</em>-channels) or 7.1(<em>8</em>-channels),
we need to replace the 9-pin switch to 21-pin or 27-pin switch.</p>

<p>In fact, the circuit is just a simple track selector,
so itâ€™s not only an audio source selector for a speaker,
but also a speaker switcher for a computer.
That is, you can either share one speaker with two computers,
or share one computer with two speakers.</p>

<p>In general, it needs <script type="math/tex">(n + 1) * (k + 1)</script> pins/wires to make a device selector
for one <em>n</em>-channels output device with <em>k</em> (<em>n</em>-channels) input sources,
or <em>k</em> output devices with <em>n</em>-channels and one (<em>n</em>-channels) input source.
The first <script type="math/tex">+1</script> is for the <em>ground wire</em>,
and the second <script type="math/tex">+1</script> is for the <em>input</em> or <em>output</em> device.</p>
