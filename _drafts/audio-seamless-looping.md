- Problem
  - What is audio seamless looping?
  - Why we can't loop audio seamlessly now? Why we have a silence gap?
  - What is the current flow to play an audio track?
  - What is the bottleneck in the current flow to loop audio?
  - Can we improve the current flow to break through the bottleneck?
  - If not, why?
- Solution
  - How can we make audio-looping seamlessly?
- Testing
  - How to check an audio is looped seamlessly?
