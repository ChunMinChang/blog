# Chun-Min Chang
Hi, I am Chun-Min Chang (Kun-BÃ­n Tiunn), a self-directed learner and a maker who enjoys building products from original ideas. As a born risk-taker with curiosity, I keep trying new things and challenging myself.

I see things as patterns and feel at ease analyzing, categorizing and re-linking them. Since the clues within show me the way to systematically predict, I enjoy bringing rules to automate routines with a methodical manner.

When I was child, I have dreamt about becoming a craftsman, an author, an architect, or a scientist. Now, I build products by hands as a craftsman; write quality code as an author; design software models as an architect; analyze and solve problems as a scientist.

I am a software engineer. I am living all of my dreams in my daily life.
