# Chun-Min Chang
Hi, I am Chun-Min Chang, a software engineer. Everyday, I couldn't help but notice the things going on around me. They are patterns to me and I almost automatically analyze, categorize and re-link them. As a born risk-taker with curiosity, I keep trying new things and challenging myself.

Playing guitar is my enjoyment. Music emblematize my passion for creative expression; Engineering background stands my creative understanding from multiple angles. I am also a self-directed learner and a maker who enjoys building products from original ideas.
