# Chun-Min Chang
Hi, I am Chun-Min Chang, a software engineer.
Everyday, I couldn't help but notice the things going on around me.
They are patterns to me and I almost automatically analyze,
categorize and re-link them.
As a born risk-taker with curiosity,
I keep trying new things and challenging myself.

Playing guitar is my enjoyment.
Music emblematize my passion for creative expression;
Engineering background stands my creative understanding from multiple angles.
I am also a self-directed learner
and a maker who enjoys building products from original ideas.
