# Requiring Android build-tools for Fennec

To build fennec, I run ```$./mach bootstrap``` under my _gecko-dev_ repo
and select _Firefox for Android_ to install all stuff for development.

```
Please choose the version of Firefox you want to build:
1. Firefox for Desktop Artifact Mode
2. Firefox for Desktop
3. Firefox for Android Artifact Mode
4. Firefox for Android

Note on Artifact Mode:
...
...

Your choice: 4

Looks like you have Homebrew installed. We will install all required packages via Homebrew.

...
```

Next, I create/modify the _mozconfig_(or _.mozconfig_) under my _gecko-dev_ repo:
```
# Build Firefox for Android:
ac_add_options --enable-application=mobile/android
ac_add_options --target=arm-linux-androideabi

# With the following Android SDK and NDK:
ac_add_options --with-android-sdk="/Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-sdk-macosx"
ac_add_options --with-android-ndk="/Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-ndk-r11c"
```

However, there are still error shown when I build by ```./mach build```:
```
...
...
 0:09.78 DEBUG: configure:10912: checking if app-specific confvars.sh exists
 0:09.78 DEBUG: configure:11077: checking for Android SDK platform version 23
 0:09.78 DEBUG: configure:11085: checking for Android build-tools
 0:09.78 DEBUG: configure: error: You must install the Android build-tools version 23.0.3.  Try |mach bootstrap|.  (Looked for /Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-sdk-macosx/build-tools/23.0.3)
 0:09.78 ERROR: old-configure failed
 0:09.82 *** Fix above errors and then restart with               "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make -f client.mk build"
 0:09.82 make: *** [configure] Error 1
```

To solve this, I check whether ```/Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-sdk-macosx/build-tools/23.0.3``` exists.
```
$ ls /Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-sdk-macosx/
SDK Readme.txt	extras		platforms		tools
add-ons		platform-tools	temp
```
There is really no ```build-tools```, so I need to install it by my own.

I open the _SDK Readme.txt_ to know what I could do:
```
$ cd /Users/cchang/.mozbuild/android-sdk-macosx/
$ vim SDK\ Readme.txt
...
...
To start the SDK Manager, please execute the program "android".

From the command-line you can also directly trigger an update by
executing:
  tools/android update sdk --no-ui

Tip: use --help to see the various command-line options.
...
...
```

From above, we could run ```$ tools/android``` to install what we need:
![Android SDK Manager][android-sdk-mgr]
After the selected items are installed, we can successfully build the fennec!
