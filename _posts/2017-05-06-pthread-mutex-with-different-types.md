When I tried to [produce a deadlock in _CoreAudio_][DL-AU] with pthread,
I realized that the _mutex_ with __NORMAL__ type locked by one pthread
could be unlocked by another pthread.
Normally, this behavior should be __disallowed__.
It will result in undefined behaviors.
If one pthread could unlock a mutex owned by other thread whenever it wants,
then the mutex will be meaningless,
unless it's a expected behavior.

In my case, it's exactly what I want, 
because I need to break the deadlock to continue the program.
However, in most case, this behavior should be __forbidden__,
so I do some research about
what the behaviors of mutexes with different types are.

Here is my conclusion:
