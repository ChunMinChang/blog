To calculate the duration of one *MP3* file,
we need to know how it is encoded first.
The estimation for the durtation is different
based on how they are encoded.

## CBR(Constant Bitrate) vs VBR(Variable Bitrate) Encoding

*MP3* can be encoded either with **constant bitrate**(**CBR**)
or **variable bitrate**(**VBR**).
The quality of the *MP3* encoded with *VBR* is better than one with *CBR*
since each frame can adopt different bitrate where the music needs it,
while the *CBR* file uses same bitrate regardless of what sound wave is.

## How to know whether the file is CBR or VBR

There are two types for the *MP3* header, **Xing** and **VBRI**.
The *ID* of the *Xing* header is either **Xing** or **Info**;
The *ID* of *VBRI* header is **VBRI**.

If the *ID* of *Xing* header is **Info**,
then it is definitely encoded with *CBR*.
Nevertheless, *CBR* is a special case of *VBR*
and therefore labelling *Xing* as the header ID of a *CBR* file
is logically acceptable.

## How to estimate the duration

### CBR(Constant Bitrate)

The calculation for *CBR* *MP3* is straightforward:

$$
\text{Duration (seconds)} = \frac{ \text{File Size (bits)} }{ \text{Bitrate (bits/second)} }
$$

The unit of *file size* is usually *bytes*,
so the *bit size* of the file is ```file size(bytes) * 8```.

### VBR(Variable Bitrate)

The calculation for *VBR* *MP3* is a little complicated:

$$
\text{Duration (seconds)} = \frac{ \text{ Samples Per Frame $\cdot$ Total Frames (samples)} }{ \text{Sample Rate (samples/second)} }
$$

The duration is **not accurate** when the *total frames* above
is an **estimated** value.
If the total frames isn't predefined, then we need to estimate it by:

$$
\text{Estimated Total Frames} = \frac{ \text{File Size} }{ \text{Average Frame Size} }
$$

### Live stream

No matter what type the *MP3* is encoded with,
the duration is calculated by the **file size**,
but what if the *file size* is **unknown**?
Before addressing the question, we should ask
what type of media will have an unknown file size.
The answer is **live stream**.

No one knows when the live stream will be closed. It could be anytime.
Hence we don't need to calculate the duration beforehand in this case.
We just need to make sure the position of the playback
stays at the end of the media track and the end-time keeps increasing.

(The position stays at the end of the media track during streaming.)

However, for those live stream with **opening remark**,
we still need to estimate how long the opening talk will be
and show the playback UI as it's a non-live stream
before it finish introducing and start streaming.
After finishing the opening talk,
the UI should behave as the same as it's a live stream.

or go to [shoutcast](https://www.shoutcast.com/) and play *KHNY Honey 103* under Genre *Jazz*)


As *file size* is unknown, we should use [*number of frames*](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8295/MPEG-Audio-Frame-Header#XINGHeader)
([example](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f6f1731b1b7fec332f86b55fa40e2c9ae67ac39b/dom/media/mp3/MP3FrameParser.cpp#452,475-479))
to calculate the duration of the opening introduction([example](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/22c55eb7b7e6494a8615a7af3b613ff899d2cdba/dom/media/mp3/MP3Demuxer.cpp#389-395)).
(The *number of frames* here is same as the *total frames* mentioned
in the duration estimation of *VBR MP3*)

To sum up this case, the ending time shown on playback at first
should be the duration of the opening talk.
After the playback's position reaches the end, it should stay at the end
and the duration should keep increasing during streaming music.

#### How to know whether the file size is unknown

Usually, the *file size* of a live stream will be set to ```-1```.
