I developed some tools to speed up the process for debugging malfunctions on audio.
A simple table shows the audio hardware information and configuration.
A device selector let me easily switch the audio sources
from different platforms/computers.

## Software

### Firefox
Knowledge about the audio setting and its hardware information is necessary
when we try to investigate the problems on audio.
Unfortunately, it's hard to know the audio configuration
on the dysfunctional machine.
It usually takes a few days to get this information from the reporters.

#### about:support
To reduce the workload on communication,
I create a table shows the audio hardware information
on **about:support** in Firefox

When reporters file bugs, they can attach these information as well
so we don't need to ask them for their settings.

##### Further works
There are some left works.
I will try to arrange my time to finish them.

- [Show driver version of the sound card][b1378633]
- Show unique hardware id
- Integrate this info to crash report

## Hardware

### Audio Device Selector
I need to frequently switch between computers with different OS
to check the audio works on different platforms.
It's annoying to unconnect the speaker from one computer
and then connect it to another computer again and again.
Therefore, I made a device selector that can switch the audio sources
of the speaker by simply flipping the controller.

The circuit is super easy. It's nothing more than a switch.

The above circuit diagram is for stereo speaker.
If the speaker is 5.1 or 7.1,
we need to replace the 6-pin switch to 18 pin or 24-pin switch.

In fact, the circuit is a simple track selector,
so it's not only an audio source selector for a speaker,
but also a speaker switcher for a computer.
That is, you can connect two speakers to a computer
and select what speaker you want to play.

## Future Plan

There are several ideas I believe it could ease my life as a developer:
- Virtual Audio Device
  - Something like [Soundflower][soundflower] but it's cross-platform
  and provides APIs to install/uninstall devices
  or access the buffer data for analysis.
- Cross-platform Commands Warpper providing functions like
  - Disable/Enable audio devices.
  - Generate audio samples(by FFmpeg?)
