## Introduction for Audio 5.1

Audio *five-point one* is a common surround sound 
layouted in home theater.
It has totally six channels: five speakers and a subwoofer
and this is where the term *five-point one* comes from.

## Channel Layout

Since we have more than one channel,
we need to define an explicit channel ordering
to know which channel the sent/received data is matched to.

The channel layout is a particular arrangement for the channels.
The famous layout is *stereo*, that provides two channels:
one is *left*, the other is *right*, 
and their order is *left* and *right*.

The arrangement for the channels is different from format to format.
The most common formats are *Wave Format Extensible*(or *WaveEx*)
and *Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers*(or *SMPTE*).
They defines what channels are provided and
the ordering of them in different layouts.

In this post, we follow the *SMPTE* format.
An advantage of taking this standard is that
it specifies the *up/downmixing* behaviours
between different layouts.
(The SMPTE's standard for multichannel are
[ITU-R BS.775][bs775-3] and [ITU-R BS.2159-7][bs2159-7].)

### Channels

Before knowing how the channels is sorted,
we should know what channel is provided.

| Code | Channel Name                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| M    | Mono                             |
| L    | Left (Front Left)                |
| R    | Right (Front Right)              |
| C    | Center (Front Center)            |
| LS   | Left Surround (Side Left)        |
| RS   | Right Surround (Side Right)      |
| RLS  | Rear Left Surround (Back Left)   |
| RC   | Rear Center (Back Center)        |
| RRS  | Rear Right Surround (Back Right) |
| LFE  | Low Frequency Effects            |

### Layouts

The layout in *SMPTE*'s format is as follows.
Each layout is defined by a particular permutation
of the above channels.

(The sample code to set channel layout on OSX is [here][channel-layout].)

<!--

| DUAL-MONO-LFE | L | R | LFE |
| MONO          | M |
| MONO-LFE      | M | LFE |
| STEREO        | L | R |
| STEREO-LFE    | L | R | LFE |

## Mixing

We already know that the audio layout can be configured into different types
based on the number of the channels.
The question is: what should we do when the input layout from the audio source 
doesn't match the user's output layout?

If the two channel layouts are equal, 
then they must have same numbers of channels and same channel order.
Conversely, if two audio settings have different numbers of channels
(e.g., {L, R} and {M, LFE}),
or they have same numbers of channels but different orders
(e.g., {L, R} and {R, L}),
then they must have different channel layouts.

When the **input layout is different from the output layout**, 
we need to convert the audio input data to fit the audio output's configuration.
We call it **mixing**.

(The sample code to mix audio data on OSX is [here][mixing].)

### Mixing matrix
![Mixing matrix][mixing-matrix]

Although it may have different definitions
to convert the audio data from input into output,
they can be summarized into the following equations.
The above figure illustrates their relationships,
and the value of $$m_{ij}$$ varies from definition to definition.

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= m_{11} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{12} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{13} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{14} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{15} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{16} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= m_{21} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{22} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{23} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{24} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{25} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{26} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
C_{out} &= m_{31} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{32} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{33} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{34} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{35} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{36} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
LFE_{out} &= m_{41} \cdot L_{in} +
             m_{42} \cdot R_{in} +
             m_{43} \cdot C_{in} +
             m_{44} \cdot LFE_{in} +
             m_{45} \cdot LS_{in} +
             m_{46} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
LS_{out} &= m_{51} \cdot L_{in} +
            m_{52} \cdot R_{in} +
            m_{53} \cdot C_{in} +
            m_{54} \cdot LFE_{in} +
            m_{55} \cdot LS_{in} +
            m_{56} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= m_{61} \cdot L_{in} +
            m_{62} \cdot R_{in} +
            m_{63} \cdot C_{in} +
            m_{64} \cdot LFE_{in} +
            m_{65} \cdot LS_{in} +
            m_{66} \cdot RS_{in}
\end{align}
$$

To simplify them, we can rewite these equations into a matrix form:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{Audio_{out}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  L_{out} \\ 
  R_{out} \\ 
  C_{out} \\ 
  LFE_{out} \\ 
  LS_{out} \\ 
  RS_{out}
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
  m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & m_{14} & m_{15} & m_{16} \\
  m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} & m_{24} & m_{25} & m_{26} \\
  m_{31} & m_{32} & m_{33} & m_{34} & m_{35} & m_{36} \\
  m_{41} & m_{42} & m_{43} & m_{44} & m_{45} & m_{46} \\
  m_{51} & m_{52} & m_{53} & m_{54} & m_{55} & m_{56} \\
  m_{61} & m_{62} & m_{63} & m_{64} & m_{65} & m_{66} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
  L_{in} \\ 
  R_{in} \\
  C_{in} \\
  LFE_{in} \\
  LS_{in} \\
  RS_{in}
\end{bmatrix}
\\
&=
\vec{Matrix_{mixing}} \cdot \vec{Audio_{in}}
\end{align}
$$

### Downmixing

When **numbers of input channels > numbers of output channels**,
we call it **downmixing**.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)
The most common case for downmixing is to
downmix different audio layouts into *stereo*.
The audio sources on the internet have various layouts
while most users only have two speakers.

(The downward mixing mechanism of SMPTE for audio 5.1
is defined in [Table 2 of ITU-R BS.775-3][bs775-3].)

##### Downmix audio 5.1 to stereo(stereophonic sound)
![Downmix 5.1 to stereo][dowmix-5point1-to-stereo]

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot LS_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot RS_{in} +
\end{align}
$$

##### Downmix audio 5.1 to quad(quadraphonic sound/4.0 surround sound)
![Downmix 5.1 to quad][dowmix-5point1-to-quad]

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} 
\\
LS_{out} &= LS_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= RS_{in}
\end{align}
$$

### Upmixing

When **numbers of input channels < numbers of output channels**,
we call it **upmixing**.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)

The most common case for this is to upmix *stereo* data(2 channels).
into *3F2-LFE/audio 5.1*(6 channels).
There are several papers discussing how to do that.

### Other case

The other case happens
when **numbers of input channels = numbers of output channels**,
but their channel layouts are different.

The conversion is easy as converting 
from *STEREO-LFE*: {L, R, LFE} to *3F*: {L, R, C} (simply passing data):

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in}
\\
C_{out} &= 0
\end{align}
$$

;it's also as complicated as converting
from *3F1*: {L, R, C, RC} to *2F2(or quad)*: {L, R, LS, RS}:

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} + p \cdot C_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} + p \cdot C_{in} 
\\
LS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\end{align}
$$
, where $$p, q$$ are specific values.

## Implementation
Many open source cross-platform audio libraries are good refereces:
- [cubeb][cubeb]
- [portaudio][portaudio]
- [libsoundio][libsoundio]

My experience for developling multi-channel is limited on *cubeb*.
From my experience, all the documents for audio development are vague
and sometimes you even cannot find
how to use the API on some platforms(especially on OSX).
The best way to learn that is to read the source code on github.
