## Introduction for Audio 5.1

Audio *five-point one* is a common surround sound 
layouted in home theater.
It has totally six channels: five speakers and a subwoofer
and this is where the term *five-point one* comes from.

## Channel Layout

Since we have more than one channel,
we need to define an explicit channel ordering
to know which channel the sent/received data is matched to.

Channel layout specifies the order 
of input/output channel data in audio buffer. 
For example, if the layout is stereo, then we have two channel data.
The first data is for left channel, the second one is right channel.

The arrangement for the channels is different from format to format.
The most common formats are defined in *Wave Format Extensible*(or *WaveEx*)
or by *Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers*(or *SMPTE*).
They defines what channels are provided and
the ordering of them in different layouts.

In this post, we follow the *SMPTE* format.
An advantage of taking this standard is that
it specifies the *up/downmixing* behaviours
between different layouts.
(The SMPTE's standard for multichannel can be founded in
[ITU-R BS.775][bs775-3] and [ITU-R BS.2159-7][bs2159-7].)

### Channels

Before knowing how the channels are sorted,
we should know what channel is provided.

| Code | Channel Name                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| M    | Mono                             |
| L    | Left (Front Left)                |
| R    | Right (Front Right)              |
| C    | Center (Front Center)            |
| LS   | Left Surround (Side Left)        |
| RS   | Right Surround (Side Right)      |
| RLS  | Rear Left Surround (Back Left)   |
| RC   | Rear Center (Back Center)        |
| RRS  | Rear Right Surround (Back Right) |
| LFE  | Low Frequency Effects            |

### Layouts

The layout in *SMPTE*'s format is as follows.
Each layout is defined by a particular permutation
of the above channels.

(The sample code to set channel layout on OSX is [here][channel-layout].)

<!--

| DUAL-MONO-LFE | L | R | LFE |
| MONO          | M |
| MONO-LFE      | M | LFE |
| STEREO        | L | R |
| STEREO-LFE    | L | R | LFE |
| 3F            | L | R | C |

## Mixing

We already know that the audio layout can be configured into different types
based on the number of the channels.
The question is: what should we do when the input layout from the audio source
doesn't match the user's output layout?

If the two channel layouts are equal, 
then they must have same numbers of channels and same channel order.
Conversely, if two audio settings have different numbers of channels
(e.g., {L, R} and {M, LFE}),
or they have same numbers of channels but different orders
(e.g., {L, R} and {R, L}),
then they must have different channel layouts.

When the **input layout is different from the output layout**, 
we need to convert the audio input data to fit the audio output's configuration.
We call it **mixing**.

[Here][mixing] is the audio-mixer that can mix audio data
from any input channel layout to any output channel layout.
It's implemented in *Rust* and used in *Firefox*.

### Mixing matrix

![Mixing matrix][mixing-matrix]

Although it may have different definitions
to convert the audio data from input into output,
they can be summarized into the following equations.
The above figure illustrates their relationships,
and the value of $$m_{ij}$$ varies from definition to definition.

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= m_{11} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{12} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{13} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{14} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{15} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{16} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= m_{21} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{22} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{23} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{24} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{25} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{26} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
C_{out} &= m_{31} \cdot L_{in} +
           m_{32} \cdot R_{in} +
           m_{33} \cdot C_{in} +
           m_{34} \cdot LFE_{in} +
           m_{35} \cdot LS_{in} +
           m_{36} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
LFE_{out} &= m_{41} \cdot L_{in} +
             m_{42} \cdot R_{in} +
             m_{43} \cdot C_{in} +
             m_{44} \cdot LFE_{in} +
             m_{45} \cdot LS_{in} +
             m_{46} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
LS_{out} &= m_{51} \cdot L_{in} +
            m_{52} \cdot R_{in} +
            m_{53} \cdot C_{in} +
            m_{54} \cdot LFE_{in} +
            m_{55} \cdot LS_{in} +
            m_{56} \cdot RS_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= m_{61} \cdot L_{in} +
            m_{62} \cdot R_{in} +
            m_{63} \cdot C_{in} +
            m_{64} \cdot LFE_{in} +
            m_{65} \cdot LS_{in} +
            m_{66} \cdot RS_{in}
\end{align}
$$

To simplify them, we can rewite these equations into a matrix form:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{Audio_{out}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  L_{out} \\ 
  R_{out} \\ 
  C_{out} \\ 
  LFE_{out} \\ 
  LS_{out} \\ 
  RS_{out}
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
  m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & m_{14} & m_{15} & m_{16} \\
  m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} & m_{24} & m_{25} & m_{26} \\
  m_{31} & m_{32} & m_{33} & m_{34} & m_{35} & m_{36} \\
  m_{41} & m_{42} & m_{43} & m_{44} & m_{45} & m_{46} \\
  m_{51} & m_{52} & m_{53} & m_{54} & m_{55} & m_{56} \\
  m_{61} & m_{62} & m_{63} & m_{64} & m_{65} & m_{66} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
  L_{in} \\ 
  R_{in} \\
  C_{in} \\
  LFE_{in} \\
  LS_{in} \\
  RS_{in}
\end{bmatrix}
\\
&=
\vec{Matrix_{mixing}} \cdot \vec{Audio_{in}}
\end{align}
$$

### Downmixing

When **numbers of input channels > numbers of output channels**,
we call it **downmixing**.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)
The most common case for downmixing is to
downmix different audio layouts into *stereo*.
The audio sources on the internet have various layouts
while most users only have two speakers.

(The downward mixing mechanism of SMPTE for audio 5.1
is defined in [Table 2 of ITU-R BS.775-3][bs775-3].)

##### Downmix audio 5.1 to stereo(stereophonic sound)

![Downmix 5.1 to stereo][dowmix-5point1-to-stereo]

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot LS_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} +
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot RS_{in} +
\end{align}
$$

##### Downmix audio 5.1 to quad(quadraphonic sound/4.0 surround sound)

![Downmix 5.1 to quad][dowmix-5point1-to-quad]

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot C_{in} 
\\
LS_{out} &= LS_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= RS_{in}
\end{align}
$$

### Upmixing

When **numbers of input channels < numbers of output channels**,
we call it **upmixing**.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)

The most common case for this is to upmix *stereo* data(2 channels)
into *3F2-LFE/audio 5.1*(6 channels).
There are several papers discussing how to achieve that.

### Other case

The other case happens
when **numbers of input channels = numbers of output channels**,
but their channel layouts are different.

The conversion is easy as converting 
from *STEREO-LFE*: {L, R, LFE} to *3F*: {L, R, C} (simply passing data):

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in}
\\
C_{out} &= 0
\end{align}
$$

;it's also as complicated as converting
from *3F1*: {L, R, C, RC} to *2F2(or quad)*: {L, R, LS, RS}:

$$
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} + p \cdot C_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} + p \cdot C_{in} 
\\
LS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\end{align}
$$
, where $$p, q$$ are specific values.

## Implementation

Many open source cross-platform audio libraries are good refereces
to learn how to implement multi-channel on different platforms, such as

- [cubeb][cubeb]
- [portaudio][portaudio]
- [libsoundio][libsoundio]

My experience for developling multi-channel is limited on *cubeb*.
The development project page is hosted [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/multichannel).
From my experience, most documents for audio development are vague
and sometimes you even cannot find the official manuals
about how to use the APIs(especially on OSX).
The best way to learn that is to read the source code on github.
Read the how other people use the APIs
or the APIs' implementation directly if it's possible.

It's time to rock on the code!
