To make some fun in a snowing night,
I built a simple audio reactive LED
that can dance(blink) with the music.

It's an easy project for killing time
since the circuit just contains a couple of electronic components.

I am not a professional electronic engineer.
I cannot guarantee it won't burn down your house
if you run that circuit all night long.

I bet you will get much more fun
if you dance with real humans rather than the LED circuit!
