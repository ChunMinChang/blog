*LRU(Least Recently Used)* table is a simple data structure
that is composed of *hash table* and *linked list*.
The *insert*, *erase*, *lookup/search* can be done naturally in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$
by its *hash-table* part. But the best thing is,
it can return the *least* or *most* recently used data in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$
by the its *linked-list* in a *least-to-most* recently used order.

# Use Cases

There are several use cases
- (LRU) cache:
  A data cache with limited capacity that only cache the most recently touched $$N$$-element
- Focus problem:
  Keep tracking the touched elements, in a least-to-most recently used order
  - For example, in browser, we may want to prioritize the media elements by the touched-by-user order
  - We can give user a way for a user to control the last touched media element.
  One media element at a time.
  - If the last touched media element is destroyed,
  then the user can control the second-last touched media element, and so on.

The real worl use case is a [`mediabuffer`][mediabuffer-chromium] with [*LRU* mechanism][lru-chromium] in *chromium*
