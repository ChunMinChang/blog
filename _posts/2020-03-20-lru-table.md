*LRU(Least Recently Used)* table is a simple data structure
that is composed of *hash table* and *linked list*.
The *insert*, *erase*, *lookup/search* can be done naturally in *O(1)*
by its *hash-table* part. But the best thing is,
it can return the *least* or *most* recently used data in *O(1)*
by the its *linked-list* in a *least-to-most* recently used order.

## Use Cases

There are several use cases:

- (LRU) cache:
  - A data cache with limited capacity that only cache the most recently touched $$N$$-element
  - The real worl use case is a [`mediabuffer`][mediabuffer-chromium] with [*LRU* mechanism][lru-chromium] in *chromium*
- Focus problem:
  Keep tracking the touched elements, in a least-to-most recently used order
  - For example, in browser, we may want to prioritize the elements by the touched-by-user order
  - We can give user a way for a user to control the last touched element. One element at a time.
  - If the last touched element is destroyed, then the user can control the second-last touched element, and so on.
