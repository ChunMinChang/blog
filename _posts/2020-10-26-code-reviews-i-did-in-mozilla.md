Giving code-review is an essential part of my daily job as a software engineer. I always try my best to help my peers to address the problem properly when doing a review. For anyone who is interested in my reviews, this post lists some of the code-reviews I did in Mozilla.

This post organizes some code reviews I did in Mozilla in the past.
I hope this post can be a reference for myself to check if my review skills improve or not when I look back several years later. Aside from that, this is a reference for anyone who is interested in my review quality.

## Self-evaluation

I can review code effectively and help the reviewees to notice the defects in their patches or the potential bugs they miss. There are some examples as follow. What's more, I am able to explain some subtle software-engineering principles clearly with verbal comments, such as [what is over-engineering and why is it bad][overengineering], or [why is adding code for a specific case bad][specific-code-is-bad]. I am able to deliver clear messages to make my teammates understand what I am talking about exactly so we can make the code better together.

### Comment Style

Tone matters. Different tone makes different impression, yet there is some tones I avoid.

I don't use "you" in my comments, since what I judge is "code" instead of "author" ("person").
I use "why" more often than "it's wrong". *Wrong* implies I know what exactly *right* is, which is not the case most of the time. *Wrong* means the *current result* is different from the *expected result*. But the *expected result* is often vague. In that case, there is no *wrong* and *right*. I always compare the *pros* and *cons* between the different approaches, instead of saying *wrong* and *right* based on my personal judgements. I only use *wrong* when the *expected result* is clearly *define*d (e.g., by a certain spec). Asking *Why* is a better way to know the reason for making a certain *trade-off*.

### Review Focus

I focus more on the *problem* than the *solution*.

I believe how well we define a problem determines how well we solve it. I focus on what the problem exactly is and why and when the problem occurs. The deeper we dig into the problem, the higher chance we can find out the root cause. There is always more than one approach to solve the problem. But it's impossible to find the most appropriate solution without knowing what the root cause is. I tend to ask why the problem occurs before reviewing the code detailedly (one example [here](https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/pull/597#issuecomment-663144179)). The syntax, style, or code-pattern is less important. After all, doing the right thing is more important than doing things right.

Challenging assumptions, considering a broader or narrower version of the problem, or rephrasing the problems are common ways to look at the problem from different perspectives.

## Code Reviews in Mozilla

To be clear, I am not expressing the following code is bad. Most of the time my teammates’ code is generally good! The following list is only used to prove I do my daily job conscientiously and I don’t live up to my teammates’ trust. They are all awesome engineers. They are happier if I can catch some errors before the errors are shipped to the users ends.

### Terms

  - cubeb-coreaudio: The cubeb implementation on MacOS via `AudioUnit` APIs
  - cubeb-pulse: The cubeb implementation on Linux via `libpulseaudio` APIs

There should be more reviews I did. But the above are what I can remember for now.

## Other Reviews and Communications

I am also willing to raise my opinions outside of Mozilla. When implementing the media-session, I filed several [spec issues](https://github.com/w3c/mediasession/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3AChunMinChang) and proposed [potential solutions](https://github.com/w3c/mediasession/issues/234#issuecomment-530540930).

The team-wise communication is a important part to make the whole team succeed. I am willing to help the team members to get the information they need to take further actions, or share my views to any problem I spot. For example, I reported a *WebRTC* device-switching bug and gave a [code analysis about the cause and its possible solutions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1572281#c2) even though *WebRTC* is not the area I was working on. I also let the *mp4parse-rust* contributors noticed their new test settings [cannot work with Rust Nightly](https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust/pull/205#issuecomment-597326901) so they can fix it.

## Closing Words

I hope the review-records here can reveal a part of my daily job. It's a reference to myself and to anyone who is interested in my review skills. Code-review is an important part to help the whole team succeed. Besides my daily programming work, I try my best to help others.

During the pademic, I come to realize what mindset I need to have when reviewing the patches from my peers. I come to realize that everyone needs companionship and constructive suggestions -- Cut right to the point, but “you don’t have to face the difficulty alone”.
