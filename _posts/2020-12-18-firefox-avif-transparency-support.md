Transparent AVIF images work in Firefox now!

<!--read more-->

I've finished the AVIF image transparency support in Firefox recently,
in [BMO 1654462][BMO1654462].

The AVIF support can be enabled by toggling the `image.avif.enabled` in `about:config` to `true` (it's `false` by default). As far as I know, it's the last piece of the main AVIF work that has to be done. Hopefully the `image.avif.enabled` would be set to `true` by default soon.

To be honest, I am just lucky enough to pick this topic to implement the last piece.
Most of the hard works are done by our excellent [`mp4parse-rust`](https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust) developers and the [original AVIF decoder author][BMO1625363]. They give me great advices and help me to achieve this work.

## How the AVIF image decoding work

The steps to render an AVIF image to the screen from the raw data are as follows:

1. Extract the AVIF image data from the mp4 container.
   - The AVIF image is stored in the mp4 format, so we need to get its data first
   - we use [`mp4parse-rust`](https://github.com/mozilla/mp4parse-rust/blob/3d9efdc868ce8c5767cea28708fa6512c0ab6d17/mp4parse_capi/src/lib.rs#L1183-L1215) to parse the AVIF image in Firefox
2. Decode the AVIF image to Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha data by [Dav1d or AOM decoder][AVIFDecoder]
   - Dav1d is the video/image decoder for AV1/AVIF format.
   - `libavif` has some examples (or you can use `libavif` directly)
     - [Dav1d][libavif-dav1d-example]
     - [AOM][libavif-aom-example]
3. Convert the Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha data into RGBA data
   - The conversion here is the critical part of this project.
4. Render the decoded RGBA data to the screen
   - This part is relatively easy since Firefox already has APIs to do this job for all other image formats or videos.

## Challenge

The biggest challenge in this project is to convert the Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha data into RGBA data correctly. This conversion is the only part that we don't exactly know how to do in Firefox.

To know how to convert the Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha data into RGBA data, first thing I do is to look at the third-party library used in Firefox to convert the Y-Cb-Cr to RGB data. The third-party library is [*libyuv*][libyuv]. Fortunately, I saw one function that can transform the Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha into RGBA data if the Y-Cb-Cr's data layout is *I420*. There are many different layouts of the Y-Cb-Cr's data, such as *I444* or *I422*. Therefore, the problem is narrowed down to convert the Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha into RGBA data if Y-Cb-Cr's data layout is *not I420*.

The next task is to look at the function that converts Y-Cb-Cr-Alpha to RGBA data for the *I420* layout to see how the conversion is implemented and evaluate if it's possible to apply its manner to other forms.

The answer is yes.Â The conversion for the *I420* layout is a 3-step process:

1. It converts the Y-Cb-Cr to RGB data and fills the RGB data into the RGBA buffer.
2. It injects the Alpha data into the RGBA buffer.
3. It does the "pre-attenuate" if the caller requests it.

The last two steps are unrelated to the Y-Cb-Cr 's layout. To apply the same approach to the *non-I420* layout, the only thing I need to figure out is how to convert the Y-Cb-Cr to RGB data. The problem now is narrowed down to the conversion for non-I420 layout. Fortunately, the [`libyuv`][libyuv] library already provides such functions. All I need to do is call the operations depends on the Y-Cb-Cr 's layout, then fill the alpha data and do the "pre-attenuate" if required. As a result, the conversion works as follows:

```
YCbCrA_to_RGBA:
  if the layout is I420 format
    call libyuv::I420AlphaToARGB
  else
    convert the Y-Cb-Cr data to R-G-B data via YCbCr_to_RGBA32
    fill the Alpha data to the RGBA32 buffer
    attenuate RGBA data

YCbCr_to_RGBA32:
  switch layout:
    case I400:
        call libyuv::I400ToARGB
    case I420:
      switch color-space:
        case BT601:
          call libyuv::I420ToARGB
        case BT709:
          call libyuv::H420ToARGB
        case BT2020:
          call libyuv::U420ToARGB
    case I422:
      switch color-space:
        case BT601:
          call libyuv::I422ToARGB
        case BT709:
          call libyuv::H422ToARGB
        case BT2020:
          call libyuv::U422ToARGB
    case I444:
      switch color-space:
        case Identity:
          call GBRPlanarToARGB
        case BT601:
          call libyuv::I444ToARGB
        case BT709:
          call libyuv::H444ToARGB
        case BT2020:
          call libyuv::U444ToARGB
```

## Closing Word

2020 is a year trapping people in a specific zone and make us feel stuck in life.
I am glad I have an opportunity to embrace a new challenge
and explore a field I don't have experience in at the end of 2020.

This is my first work in the graphic area, and I enjoy it.
It reminds me that we can always try something new in life.

2020 doesn't stop me from keeping advancing myself.
I am confident that the next year and the following years won't stop me either.
This won't be the last time I try something different.
I look forward to writing a new story in my life!

2021, I am coming!
