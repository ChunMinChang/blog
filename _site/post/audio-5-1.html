<meta name="description" content="Introduction for Audio 5.1Audio five-point one is a common surround sound layouted in home theater.It has totally six channels: five speakers and a subwooferand this is where the term five-point one comes from.Channel LayoutSince we have more than one channel,we need to define an explicit channel orderingto know which channel the sent/received data is matched to.Channel layout specifies the order of input/output channel data in audio buffer. For example, if the layout is stereo, then we have two channel data.The first data is for left channel, the second one is right channel.The arrangement for the channels is different from format to format.The most common formats are Wave Format Extensible(or WaveEx)and Society of Motion Picture &amp; Television Engineers(or SMPTE).They defines what channels are provided andthe ordering of them in different layouts.In this post, we follow the SMPTE format.An advantage of taking this standard is thatit specifies the up/downmixing behavioursbetween different layouts.(The SMPTE’s standard for multichannel can be founded inITU-R BS.775 and ITU-R BS.2159-7.)ChannelsBefore knowing how the channels is sorted,we should know what channel is provided.

                        <h2 id="introduction-for-audio-51">Introduction for Audio 5.1</h2>

<p>Audio <em>five-point one</em> is a common surround sound 
layouted in home theater.
It has totally six channels: five speakers and a subwoofer
and this is where the term <em>five-point one</em> comes from.</p>

<h2 id="channel-layout">Channel Layout</h2>

<p>Since we have more than one channel,
we need to define an explicit channel ordering
to know which channel the sent/received data is matched to.</p>

<p>Channel layout specifies the order 
of input/output channel data in audio buffer. 
For example, if the layout is stereo, then we have two channel data.
The first data is for left channel, the second one is right channel.</p>

<p>The arrangement for the channels is different from format to format.
The most common formats are <em>Wave Format Extensible</em>(or <em>WaveEx</em>)
and <em>Society of Motion Picture &amp; Television Engineers</em>(or <em>SMPTE</em>).
They defines what channels are provided and
the ordering of them in different layouts.</p>

<p>In this post, we follow the <em>SMPTE</em> format.
An advantage of taking this standard is that
it specifies the <em>up/downmixing</em> behaviours
between different layouts.
(The SMPTE’s standard for multichannel can be founded in
<a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.775-3-201208-I!!PDF-E.pdf" title="ITU-R BS.775-3">ITU-R BS.775</a> and <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-BS.2159-7-2015-PDF-E.pdf" title="ITU-R BS.2159">ITU-R BS.2159-7</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Before knowing how the channels is sorted,
we should know what channel is provided.</p>

<h3 id="layouts">Layouts</h3>

<p>The layout in <em>SMPTE</em>’s format is as follows.
Each layout is defined by a particular permutation
of the above channels.</p>

<h2 id="mixing">Mixing</h2>

<p>We already know that the audio layout can be configured into different types
based on the number of the channels.
The question is: what should we do when the input layout from the audio source 
doesn’t match the user’s output layout?</p>

<p>If the two channel layouts are equal, 
then they must have same numbers of channels and same channel order.
Conversely, if two audio settings have different numbers of channels
(e.g., {L, R} and {M, LFE}),
or they have same numbers of channels but different orders
(e.g., {L, R} and {R, L}),
then they must have different channel layouts.</p>

<p>When the <strong>input layout is different from the output layout</strong>, 
we need to convert the audio input data to fit the audio output’s configuration.
We call it <strong>mixing</strong>.</p>

<p>(The sample code to mix audio data on OSX is <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChunMinChang/0de31bd5b3213409544ef89db91b696b" title="sample code for audio mixing on OSX">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Although it may have different definitions
to convert the audio data from input into output,
they can be summarized into the following equations.
The above figure illustrates their relationships,
and the value of <script type="math/tex">m_{ij}</script> varies from definition to definition.</p>

<h3 id="downmixing">Downmixing</h3>

<p>When <strong>numbers of input channels &gt; numbers of output channels</strong>,
we call it <strong>downmixing</strong>.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)
The most common case for downmixing is to
downmix different audio layouts into <em>stereo</em>.
The audio sources on the internet have various layouts
while most users only have two speakers.</p>

<p>(The downward mixing mechanism of SMPTE for audio 5.1
is defined in <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.775-3-201208-I!!PDF-E.pdf" title="ITU-R BS.775-3">Table 2 of ITU-R BS.775-3</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="upmixing">Upmixing</h3>

<p>When <strong>numbers of input channels &lt; numbers of output channels</strong>,
we call it <strong>upmixing</strong>.
(In this case, the input channel layout is definitiely
different from the output one.)</p>

<p>The most common case for this is to upmix <em>stereo</em> data(2 channels).
into <em>3F2-LFE/audio 5.1</em>(6 channels).
There are several papers discussing how to do that.</p>

<h3 id="other-case">Other case</h3>

<p>The other case happens
when <strong>numbers of input channels = numbers of output channels</strong>,
but their channel layouts are different.</p>

<p>The conversion is easy as converting 
from <em>STEREO-LFE</em>: {L, R, LFE} to <em>3F</em>: {L, R, C} (simply passing data):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in}
\\
C_{out} &= 0
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>;it’s also as complicated as converting
from <em>3F1</em>: {L, R, C, RC} to <em>2F2(or quad)</em>: {L, R, LS, RS}:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
L_{out} &= L_{in} + p \cdot C_{in}
\\
R_{out} &= R_{in} + p \cdot C_{in} 
\\
LS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\\
RS_{out} &= q \cdot RC_{in}
\end{align} %]]></script>
, where <script type="math/tex">p, q</script> are specific values.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Many open source cross-platform audio libraries are good refereces:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb" title="cubeb">cubeb</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.portaudio.com/" title="portaudio">portaudio</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://libsound.io/" title="libsoundio">libsoundio</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My experience for developling multi-channel is limited on <em>cubeb</em>.
The project page is hosted <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/multichannel">here</a>.
From my experience, all the documents for audio development are vague
and sometimes you even cannot find
how to use the API on some platforms(especially on OSX).
The best way to learn that is to read the source code on github.</p>
