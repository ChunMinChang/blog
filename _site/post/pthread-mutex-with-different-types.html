                        <p>When I tried to <a href="deadlock-when-using-audiounit">produce a deadlock in <em>CoreAudio</em></a> with pthread,
I realized that the <em>mutex</em> with <strong>NORMAL</strong> type locked by one pthread
could be unlocked by another pthread.
Normally, this behavior should be <strong>disallowed</strong>.
It will result in undefined behaviors.
If one pthread could unlock a mutex owned by other thread whenever it wants,
then the mutex will be meaningless,
unless it’s a expected behavior.</p>

<p>In my case, it’s exactly what I want, 
because I need to break the deadlock to continue the program.
However, in most case, this behavior should be <strong>forbidden</strong>,
so I do some research about
what the behaviors of mutexes with different types are.</p>

<p>Here is my conclusion:</p>

<noscript><pre># pthread

Sample code for demonstrating different behavior
in different pthread type
- *PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL*
  - This type of mutex does **not** detect deadlock
  - A thread attempting to relock this mutex without first unlocking it
    shall deadlock
  - A thread attempting to unlock a mutex locked by a different thread
    results in undefined behavior
  - A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex
    results in undefined behavior
- *PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK*
  - This type of mutex provides error checking
  - A thread attempting to relock this mutex without first unlocking
    it shall return with an error
  - A thread attempting to unlock a mutex which another thread has locked
    shall return with an error
  - A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex
    shall return with an error
- *PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE*
  - A thread attempting to relock this mutex without first unlocking it
    shall succeed in locking the mutex
    - The relocking is allowd only in the **same** thread
    - The relocking deadlock which can occur with mutexes of type
      *PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL* **cannot** occur with this type of mutex
    - Multiple locks of this mutex shall require the same number of unlocks
      to release the mutex before another thread can acquire the mutex
  - A thread attempting to unlock a mutex which another thread has locked
    shall return with an error
  - A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex
    shall return with an error
- *PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT*
  - Its default value is set to *PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL*
  - It&#39;s allowed to map its value to other types

## Scenarios and results
We have four scenarios:
1. Lock a locked mutex in same thread
2. Unlock a unlocked mutex
3. (Wait to) Lock a locked mutex owned by another thread (__normal use case__)
4. Unlock a locked mutex owned by another thread

Unlocking a mutex owned by current thread is definitely ok,
so it&#39;s exclusive in our scenarios.

The results of our scenarios in different type is:

|            | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|
| NORMAL     | ! | v | v | v |
| ERRORCHECK |   |   | v |   |
| RECURSIVE  | v |   | v |   |
| DEFAULT    | ! | v | v | v |

- ```!```: It works without any error, but it will be **self-deadlocked**
- ```v```: It works without any error
- empty: It can not works, with an error returned


## TODO
- Sample code for ```pthread_kill``` and ```pthread_detach```


## Note

### pthread_mutex_trylock
The ```pthread_mutex_trylock()``` shall be equivalent
to ```pthread_mutex_lock()```,
except that if the mutex object referenced by mutex is currently locked
(by any thread, including the current thread),
the call shall return immediately.
