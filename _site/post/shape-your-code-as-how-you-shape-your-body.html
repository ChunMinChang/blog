                        <p>The approach to refactor the code is same as how you shape the body.
You can apply what you’ve learned from workout to writing code.</p>

<!--read more-->

<p>This post introduce how I make the plan for rewriting the Firefox’s audio library,
named <a href="https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb"><em>Cubeb</em></a>, from <a href="https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/blob/master/src/cubeb_audiounit.cpp"><em>C++</em></a> into <a href="https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs"><em>Rust</em></a>.</p>

<p>The story is nothing more than a workout-training post that you’ve probably read before:
it lists all the tips a trainee needs and shows a perfect body shape demonstrating
the results for applying those tips.</p>

<p>Everyone probably knows a few tricks for making the body in a good shape
but not everyone can achieve that.
Even the shape is made, it’s hard to keep the shape.</p>

<p>The quickest way to shape the body is hiring a mean coach!
They make sure you’ve done everything right and push you to do your best.</p>

<p>Human is lazy. We only move forward when something pushes us.</p>

<h2 id="we-need-a-mean-coach-and-rust-compiler-is-the-one">We Need A Mean Coach, and <em>Rust Compiler</em> Is the One</h2>

<p>When this habit comes to programming,
I admit that sometimes I don’t stick on the coding disciplines the code should follow,
as long as the code pass the tests.
That’s why I need a code reviewer.</p>

<p>However, code reviewers aren’t always there.
The code can become out of shape a bit and a bit if no one constantly watches it.
This phenomenon reflects
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a> I’ve read.</p>

<p>To keep the code in a good style, we need a robot-reviewer that is always accountable and trustworthy.
The <strong>Rust compiler</strong> is definitely one of them.</p>

<p>If you google <em>Rust</em>, you will see comments largely divided into two groups:
Some complain the <em>Rust compiler</em> is too stupid to allow them doing things they want;
Some love the <em>Rust compiler</em> since it makes the code well-structured
and prevent them from doing stupid things.
This is same as the comments for a strict teacher or professor.</p>

<p>Gladly I am an Asian. I am totally fine with a mean coach.
I bet I’ve seen meaner one in my school life.
The <em>Rust compiler</em> is the robot-reviewer I need.</p>

<h2 id="motive-to-have-a-good-shape">Motive to Have A Good Shape</h2>

<p>There are some reasons for supporting the decision
to shape the audio library in <em>Rust</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This could reduce the developping and debugging efforts in the long run</li>
  <li>Some mysterious problem may be addressed by this deeply cleaning process</li>
  <li>It’s time to refactor the library after putting hot-fix and hot-fix</li>
</ol>

<p>Before this project, our team have successfully translated
the <em>PulseAudio</em> backend on <em>Linux</em> from <em>C</em> to <em>Rust</em> so
we believe the plan is feasible.</p>

<p>By rewriting all the code in <em>Rust</em>, which was born with good coding principals,
the human effor to review or check the code would be lower.
In addition, the <em>Rust</em>’s eco-system and community is thriving and robust.
The library can leverage many useful third-party <em>crate</em>s to fulfil our needs.
Using the third-party library can not only reduces the maintaining effort
but also <strong>embody the spirit of <em>open-source</em></strong>.</p>

<p>When translating the <em>C</em> code to the <em>Rust</em> code that follows those strict <em>Rust</em> rules,
(we pray) some mysterious issues might be addressed silently
with transforming the code structure in a stricter style.
The code would need to be refactored at some point anyway.
<em>Rust</em> seems to be the best choice for refactoring the library at this time.</p>

<h2 id="define-the-desired-shape">Define the Desired Shape</h2>

<p>The goal is straightforward enough:
translate the library into <em>Rust</em> and don’t introduce regressions.</p>

<p>In the product-level view, this is pretty similar to:
create a new flight engine by the state-of-the-art techniques,
put it in our current flights, and make our flights soar!</p>

<p>The goal is simple in high-level view, but the detailed process is hard.</p>

<p>After thinking this carefully,
there are some difficulties to make the library into a perfect <em>Rust</em> shape:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s hard to follow all the <em>Rust</em> rules when writing <em>Rust</em> itself.
It would be harder to write code in a certain way we used to do in <em>C</em> code
(especially I didn’t have much <em>Rust</em> experience at that time)</li>
  <li>It’s hard to prevent regressions.
The library code is appended patch by patch and not every patch comes with a test.
Without the check to prevent breaking each fix, it’s hard to tell
if one fix for a certain problem would be missing or not
during translating the code</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of worrying about shaping the code body in a certain way
and the side-effects may be introduced,
it’s best to make a plan to address or prevent them as best as we can.</p>

<p>The first step is to review the problems we have.</p>

<h2 id="review-what-the-problems-are">Review What the Problems Are</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I had an hour to solve a problem
I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem
and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”</p>

  <p>― Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe how well we define a problem determines how well we solve it.</p>

<p>To bring value of the rewriting project as much as possible,
the following problems need to be addressed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some assertions will be hit unexpectedly</li>
  <li>Some code are suspected to be executed in a wrong time</li>
  <li>A fix for one problem may cause another problem or regression</li>
  <li>We have platform-dependent problem but we only have high-level cross-platform intergretion tests</li>
  <li>Some issues are device-related and we don’t have any way to simulate those device operations</li>
</ol>

<p>Apparently, the test coverage needs to be enlarged.</p>

<p>The <em>3</em> can be addressed if test case can be written more often in a easier way.</p>

<p>After separating the <em>Mac OS</em>’s platform-dependent code into a standalone crate,
the platform-dependent tests can be easily implemented without considering other platforms
so <em>4</em> can be solved.</p>

<p>To address <em>5</em>, it needs to find a way to simulate the device operations.</p>

<p>The <em>2</em> might indicate some data-racing issues.
Our library manages threads inside itself.
The output and input I/O threads will be created when the audio starts playing.
The task threads would be created when the device is switching, plugging, and unplugging.
Writing multi-thread tests is helpful to hunt the potential data-racing issues
and again the APIs to simulate device operations are really necessary.</p>

<p>The <em>1</em> may be caused by calling APIs in a wrong time
or those problems only happen on specific hardwares.
By separating a large library API into several smaller APIs,
with propery unit tests and logs, can help us narrow down the scope of the causes.
It’s easier to identify a problem by testing several small APIs independently
than testing a large API at once.</p>

<h2 id="define-the-goals">Define the Goals</h2>

<p>The requirements can be organized to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enlarge test coverage
    <ul>
      <li>Find a way to simulate device switching, plugging, and unplugging</li>
      <li>Create device-related test</li>
      <li>Create multi-thread test to hunt the potential data-racing issues</li>
      <li>Create unit tests for each API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Restructure the library APIs
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the Rust <em>rules</em></li>
      <li>Deconstruct a large API into several smaller one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solve the issues we hunt during this deep-cleaning</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-a-feasible-plan">Make A Feasible Plan</h2>

<p>There are two big problems left:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to prevent the regression from being introduced by rewriting the whole library, without having enough tests?</li>
  <li>I don’t have much <em>Rust</em> experience</li>
</ol>

<p>For the problem <em>1</em>, the safest approach is: 
translating all the code on a line-by-line basis at first.
All the <em>C/C++</em> code should be translated to <em>Rust</em> plainly even they break <em>Rust</em>’s rule.
<em>Rust</em> has <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> block that allows developers to do what they used to do in <em>C</em>.
This could move all the workarounds for some special situations or devices
the library used to have at the same time when all the <em>C</em> code is rewritten in <em>Rust</em>.</p>

<p>One the other hand, the answer of the problem <em>2</em> can be found
on any advertisement flyer in the mailbox:
“We provide a month-free trial class for you to explore and experience!”.</p>

<p>Same manner can be applied here.
Writing a minimum-viable audio library in pure <em>Rust</em> first as a trial-run
can address problem <em>2</em> effectively. This process also brings many benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s able to see what the problems the rewriting will face are and how to solve them,
in advance, in a way smaller scope</li>
  <li>It shows a rough outline about what the audio APIs should look like at the end,
since it’s rewritten in pure <em>Rust</em></li>
  <li>Some APIs are reusable in the future and they’ve been tested in a way smaller scope</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the plan is divided into 4 phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a minimum-viable version of the audio library as a trial-run</li>
  <li>Translate all the lines plainly
    <ul>
      <li>Add the proper unit or intergretion tests at the same time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsafe</code> code introduced in previous stage
    <ul>
      <li>Now tests are created to support the refactoring</li>
      <li>Shipping this version in the <em>Firefox Nightly</em> to test the new APIs in the wild</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keeping refactoring the abnormal <em>Rust</em> code
    <ul>
      <li>Leverage with third-party crates to reduce the maintain efforts</li>
      <li>Split some code into sub crates to attract some contributors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="start-the-journey">Start the Journey</h2>

<p>Now, the only things I need is patience, just what I need when doing workout.
I know everything I should do but the plan is not easy to stick with.
Translating code on a line-by-line basis is dull as doing workout set.
Writing test to prevent regression is uninteresting as
calculating <em>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</em> to prevent my body from getting fat.</p>

<p>It’s is a long, hard, and lonely process.
But I find everything worth doing when the shape is finally made!
(To be clear, only the shape of code is made.)
I am happy to have the result I have at the end.</p>
